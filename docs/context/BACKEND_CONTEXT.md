# AutoWash Backend Task Breakdown

**System:** AutoWash Pro / AURA CAR CARE  
**Target Stack:** Spring Boot + PostgreSQL  
**Architecture:** Modular Monolith  
**Analysis Date:** May 2026

---

## 1. Domain Overview

### 1.1 Core Business Domains

The AutoWash Pro system operates across 6 major business domains:

1. **Authentication & Authorization** - User registration, login, OTP verification, role-based access control
2. **Customer Management** - Profiles, vehicles, booking history, personal preferences
3. **Booking & Operations** - Booking creation/lifecycle, wash session management, staff assignment, scheduling
4. **Loyalty & Rewards** - Points earning/redemption, tier management, membership benefits
5. **Admin & Governance** - Packages, promotions, vouchers, reporting, accounts directory, settings
6. **Notifications & Support** - Notification center, reminder delivery, customer support chat, unread counters

### 1.2 Key Entities

- **Users** - Customer, Staff, Admin (role-based)
- **Accounts Directory** - Admin-facing merged view of Customer, Staff, and Admin users
- **Customers** - Profiles with vehicles, loyalty points, tier membership
- **Vehicles** - Vehicle details with owner tracking and service history
- **Bookings** - Core transaction entity connecting customer → vehicles → packages → wash service
- **Wash Sessions** - Operational record of staff executing a booking
- **Live Wash Tracking** - Derived progress view from wash session status, start time, and service duration
- **Loyalty Points** - Point ledger with earning and redemption transactions
- **Packages** - Service offerings with pricing and add-ons
- **Combos** - Time-based subscription packages
- **Promotions/Vouchers** - Discount codes and promotional mechanics
- **Staff Members** - Service workers with operational status and capacity
- **Notifications** - Reminders, alerts, and audit records
- **Support Threads & Messages** - Customer-created support conversations shared by staff/admin inbox

### 1.3 Key Integrations (Future)

- SMS/OTP Gateway (Twilio, AWS SNS)
- Payment Gateway (VNPay, Stripe, MoMo)
- Email Service (SendGrid, AWS SES)
- Push Notification Service (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- WebSocket broker for support chat and wash tracking events
- Report Generation (Jasper, ReportLab)

### 1.4 Current Prototype Alignment

`README-final.md` documents the current repository as a frontend-only prototype. The backend described here is the production target that should normalize prototype behavior into durable APIs.

Important prototype facts to preserve during backend design:

- Staff UI currently uses `/staff/dashboard`, `/staff/operations`, and `/staff/check-in`; backend operation APIs should still live under `/api/v1/operations/*`.
- Admin customer management is now labeled `Accounts` and merges customer, staff, and admin records into one directory.
- Customer support chat, notification bell behavior, and live wash tracking are local-store simulations today and need backend persistence/events before production.
- Customer booking mock state and shared portal store are still split, so backend Task 12.1 remains a production-critical consolidation task.

## 5. Risk & Complexity Analysis

### 5.1 High-Risk Items

| Risk Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Data Synchronization** (Task 12.1-12.3) | **HIGH** - Customer booking & admin portal currently use separate state models. This architectural split can cause data inconsistencies and customer confusion. | Prioritize consolidation early. Create unified booking, loyalty, and promotion models before production. Run data reconciliation scripts. |
| **Loyalty Tier Discrepancy** (Task 12.2) | **MEDIUM** - Two different tier systems (Silver/Gold/Diamond vs Member/Silver/Gold/Platinum) will confuse customers and staff. | Decide on unified tier system in design phase. Plan data migration for historical records. Test tier-based discount logic thoroughly. |
| **Payment Gateway Integration** (Task 13.1-13.2) | **HIGH** - Moving from mock to real payments requires PCI compliance, secure credential handling, and idempotency. | Use established payment SDKs. Implement webhook verification. Test with sandbox environment first. |
| **No-Show & Late-Arrival Logic** | **MEDIUM** - Prototype contains both 20-minute operational no-show handling and 15-minute late-arrival logic in legacy session code. Behavior undefined. | Clarify business rule (single no-show definition). Implement consistent logic. Test with real booking scenarios. |
| **Booking Capacity Constraints** | **MEDIUM** - Shared store enforces max 3 active bookings per customer & slot capacity, but customer booking module doesn't enforce. | Unified booking state (Task 12.1) must enforce all constraints. Validate on creation, not just UI. |
| **Promotion Targeting Semantics** (BR-106) | **MEDIUM** - Admin UI offers "new customers only" but logic currently implements as "Member tier". True new-customer eligibility check needed. | Define explicit `isNewCustomer` field. Populate during registration. Use in promotion validation (not tier proxy). |
| **Support Chat Persistence** (Task 10.8) | **MEDIUM** - Prototype stores support chat in localStorage and lets staff/admin share one broad inbox. Production needs durable storage, read cursors, moderation/audit behavior, and permission checks. | Persist threads/messages server-side, model participant read state explicitly, and keep staff/admin inbox access rules visible in RBAC tests. |
| **Live Wash Tracking Accuracy** (Task 10.9) | **MEDIUM** - Prototype derives progress from local timing. Production must derive from canonical wash session status, start time, and duration to avoid false progress. | Make operation service the source of truth and push only status/timing changes over WebSocket. Let the client calculate display progress from server snapshots. |

### 5.2 Complexity Items

| Component | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Booking Lifecycle** | **HIGH** | Multiple state transitions (PENDING → CONFIRMED → CHECKED_IN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED), multiple actors (customer, staff, admin), payment integration, refund logic, loyalty posting. Requires careful state machine design and transactional consistency. |
| **Loyalty Points System** | **HIGH** | Point earning (tiered), redemption (two modes: voucher & checkout), expiry (365 days), tier calculation (monthly rolling 12-month), warnings (30/7 days), admin adjustments, all with audit trails. Complex business logic and data modeling. |
| **Tier-Based Pricing & Benefits** | **HIGH** | Tiers affect: booking windows (BR-67), max active bookings (BR-50), loyalty earning rate (BR-94), promotion eligibility (BR-103), Platinum priority (BR-51). Audit tier history. Design requires careful tier dependency mapping. |
| **Staff Assignment & Workload** | **MEDIUM** | Concurrent session tracking, workload balancing, leave/on-leave status, busy-staff validation. Requires efficient querying of active staff capacity. Consider locking mechanisms for concurrent bookings. |
| **Notification System** | **MEDIUM** | Multiple notification types (SMS, email, push, in-app), deduplication, templates, scheduling, retry logic, delivery tracking. Event-driven architecture recommended (Spring Events or message queue). |
| **Batch Jobs & Scheduling** | **MEDIUM** | Monthly tier review (Task 7.5), point expiry sweep (Task 7.6), reminder polling (Task 10.3), payment due checks (Task 10.4). Use Spring Scheduler or Quartz. Monitor for job failures. |
| **Admin Reporting** | **MEDIUM** | Multiple report types (trends, effectiveness, summaries, metrics) with flexible date ranges and aggregations. Consider reporting library (Jasper, JimuReport) or analytics service. |

### 5.3 Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:** Focus on business rule validation (BR-*), especially:
- Loyalty points calculation (BR-94, BR-93, BR-90)
- Tier thresholds and calculations (BR-97)
- Promotion and voucher eligibility (BR-103, BR-100, BR-49, BR-48)
- Booking constraints (BR-50, BR-67, BR-46, BR-45)

**Integration Testing:** Focus on multi-step workflows:
- End-to-end booking flow (registration → vehicle → booking → payment → points → loyalty tier)
- Wash session lifecycle (create → check-in → start → complete)
- Tier review & point expiry batch processes
- Admin management workflows

**Data Consistency Testing:** After Task 12.1-12.3:
- Reconcile customer booking state vs. admin portal state
- Verify single source of truth for all entities
- Load test concurrent bookings, staff assignments, payment processing
